AI Code Assistant

The AI Code Assistant is a Python application that uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model to analyze code snippets, detect potential errors, and suggest efficiency improvements. The application features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to input code and view feedback directly.

Project Overview

This project integrates AI-based analysis into a Python GUI application to assist developers in identifying common coding issues and areas for optimization. It showcases the potential for using AI to enhance code quality and streamline debugging.

Features

- Error Detection: Identifies issues like syntax errors, type mismatches, and other common coding mistakes.
- Optimization Suggestions: Offers tips to improve code efficiency and readability.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple GUI for inputting code and viewing analysis results.
- OpenAI API Integration: Connects to the GPT-4 model to deliver insightful feedback on code quality.

How It Works

1. Users input a code snippet into the provided text box.
2. Clicking "Analyze Code" sends the code to OpenAI's API for analysis.
3. The feedback, including error detection and optimization suggestions, is displayed in an output box.
- This project does not run correctly without an API key. The key is not provided in the code.

Project Structure

- `analyzer.py`: Core logic for interacting with the OpenAI API and analyzing code.
- `gui.py`: Manages the GUI, including layout and user interactions.
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application, initializing and running the GUI.
